# feature/frontend_guestViews

This branch implements the guest-facing views of the frontend.  
It contains UI components for browsing and interacting with content without user authentication.

## Purpose
- Provide a user-friendly interface for guest users.
- Lay out structure and styling of key views (e.g., search bar, start menu, loggin screens).
- Serve as the frontend basis for later functional integration with the backend.

## Scope
- Static layout and initial components for the guest view.
- Placeholder interaction patterns (e.g., search input without live results).
- Basic styling and responsive behavior.

## Dependencies
- Tied to the applicationâ€™s general frontend setup (JavaFX).

## Notes
- This branch contains no backend communication yet.
- Integrates later with `feature/search-query-integration` for live functionality.
