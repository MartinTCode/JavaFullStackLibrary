# feature/item-management

This feature branch integrates the frontend with backend functionality to enable complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for library items using the JPA model layer.

## Purpose
- Establish bidirectional communication between frontend and backend for item management
- Implement the complete lifecycle management of library items
- Provide a user interface for librarians to manage the collection effectively

## Scope
- Item creation interface and controller logic
- Item detail viewing and search capabilities 
- Update functionality for existing items
- Deletion confirmation and processing
- Form validation and error handling
- Data transfer between frontend forms and JPA entities

## Dependencies
- `feature/database-implementation`
- `feature/frontend_guestViews`
- JPA entity models for library items

## Implementation Details
- RESTful endpoints for each CRUD operation
- Form components for data entry and modification
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Response handling for success and error states
- Proper transaction management for database operations

## Notes
- This branch focuses solely on item management, not user accounts or borrowing
- Items will need proper validation before database persistence
- The minimum window size (1200x800) should accommodate all management interfaces
