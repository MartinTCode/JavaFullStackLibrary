## 🔄 Branch Workflow

We follow a simplified Git Flow model:

- **`feature/...`**: Temporary branches for new features
- **`bugfix/...`**: Branches to resolve bugs
- **`retired/feature/...`**: Completed and archived feature branches
- **`main`**: Reserved for stable, production-ready releases (not yet active)
