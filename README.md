# Development Branch

This is the active development branch of the project.  
All current feature development and integration work is based off this branch.

## Branch Structure

- `dev`: Main development branch â€” all features are branched from and merged into this.
- `main`: Currently empty and reserved for future production-ready releases.

## Status

The project is in active development.  
For now, the `main` branch is not in use and contains no commits.

## Contribution Flow

1. New features are created from `dev` (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).
2. After testing and review, features are merged back into `dev`.
3. Once the project is stable and ready for release, a version will be merged into `main`.

## Coming Soon

A full project overview, setup instructions, and documentation will be added to the `main` branch when the initial release is prepared.
