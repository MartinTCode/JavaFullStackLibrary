# feature/database-implementation

This branch contains the foundational implementation of the backend database layer.  
It defines the entity models, repositories, and initial configuration needed for persistent data storage and retrieval.

## Purpose
- Create all needed models to represent the database in backend.
- Set up the database schema and connection using JPA.
- Provide and test basic CRUD functionality for database entities.
- Serve as the backend data source for other features (e.g., search, item listing).
- Set up testing environment with logging dependencies and testutils.

## Scope
- PostgreSQL database integration.
- Entity and repository creation for domain objects.
- Basic test data setup for development purposes.

## Dependencies
- None directly; this is a core backend layer.

## Notes
- Assumes local PostgreSQL instance with appropriate user/DB setup.
