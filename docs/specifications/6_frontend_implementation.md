# Frontend Layer Implementation

Using the Figma designs:
- UI layers were built in SceneBuilder and exported as FXML.
- Controllers were created and connected to the UI.
- These steps were done **even if** the controller didn't yet interact with the backend model.
- Components that depend on backend logic were skipped at this stage.

Throughout this phase, changes were committed regularly to Git using feature branches.
