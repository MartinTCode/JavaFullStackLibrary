# Preliminary System Modeling

We built early-stage models to shape the system architecture:

- **Class Diagram**: Preliminary UML diagram showing core backend structures.
- **Database Model**: A simplified physical model of the PostgreSQL schema.
- **System Boundaries**: Delineation of what is and isn't part of the system.

These artifacts were iteratively refined as the design evolved. They can be viewed under docs/models.
