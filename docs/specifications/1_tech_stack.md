# Technology Stack

Before any modeling or coding, we decided on our full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend**: JavaFX with FXML files, designed via SceneBuilder.
- **Backend**: Java using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, connected via JDBC.
- **Build Tool**: Maven for dependency management.
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches using GitHub.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code with relevant Java and database extensions.

This ensured a consistent structure for both team collaboration and code modularity.
